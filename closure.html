     <h1>Definition (by the book)</h1>
     <p>"We mentally fill in gaps to complete a perceived shape. The idea of designing with only a part but having your viewer perceive the whole opens up interesting compositional opportunities, including the interplay of positive and negative space" (62)</p>
       <h1>Definition (in my words)</h1>
     <p>Closure is when our eye's skip ahead and assume that all elements of a design are in their completed form, even when things are missing. An image is seemingly stronger when all parts of it seem to be finished and there are no gaps or holes in it which gives it more visual hierarchy. </p>
        <h2>Real World Connection</h2>
       <p>I like to have closure when I have an argument with someone. When I am in a verbal altercation and things go unresolved, I start to fill the gaps in my head which is led by assumptions. Technically, this should give me creative license, but in this circumstance, it can create more problems between the other party and myself.</p>
