     <h1>Definition (by the book)</h1>
     <p>"Like goes with like...we can use similarity to create order and organization through unity" (62).</p>
       <h1>Definition (in my words)</h1>
     <p>Similarity is when things visually make sense to the eyes. It is when elements of design or photography are harmonious and share some sort of characteristics. The elements do not necessarily have to be congruent, but they must have a shared togetherness that is similar to the principle of rhythm.</p>
        <h2>Real World Connection</h2>
       <p>When I think about how similarity connects to the real world, I think about groups of friends. Though each individual is different in many ways, they are all friends becuase they are likely very similar to each other. Think about it, you aren't going to be friends with someone who does not share similar moral with you because you will likely find yourselves constantly disagreeing. </p>
