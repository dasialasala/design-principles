     <h1>Definition (by the book)</h1>
     <p>"Our minds will continue a pattern beyond its ending points. Further, our eyes will follow the direction of a line... Applying this concept can add a sense of direction and movement to your layout. Ergo, flow" (62).</p>
       <h1>Definition (in my words)</h1>
     <p>Continuity is when our eyes follow a path lead by something in an image paving the way of direction. It is essential a trail to where your eyes have no choice but to follow suit with the evident direction of the photo. Without continuity, a photo may lack a sense of motion and it may not be seen as more that just a still image.</p>
        <h2>Real World Connection</h2>
       <p>I observe continuity when I am driving at night. For some reason, there aren't many street lights in the neighborhoods of Blacksburg and it is hard for me to see sometimes when it is dark out. When this is the case, I follow the curvature of the lines in the road to give me a sense of direction and to help me stay in my lane.</p>

     <img src="continuity-tree.png" class="responsive" alt="tree with curved bark"/>
     <figcaption>This is a very unique tree. The curvature in the bark demonstrates that it did not grow in a straight line and my eye cannot help but to follow the curve in the bark.</figcaption>
