     <h1>Definition (by the book)</h1>
     <p>"To achieve balance, each side of the board must carry equal weight. In design, we think of balance in terms of visual weight...Radial balance refers to circular designs in which the fulcrum lies at the center...To achieve symmetrical balance each side of a bisected design must be a mirror image of the other...Asymmetry, then, reveals two unequal sides if bisected." (56).</p>
       <h1>Definition (in my words)</h1>
     <p>For a photo to have balance, each side of it must carry the same amount of weight visually. This means that one side is not more "busy" than the other and that one side is not more empty than the other. That is, unless you are employing radial or asymmetrical visual balance rather than symmetrical. </p>
        <h2>Real World Connection</h2>
       <p>I lift weights five times a week at the gym so balance is something that is really important in my life. It involves equal weight distribution. If I am loading up a barbell to perform squats, I must make sure the weight I load on is symmetrical so the weight carries an equal load on each of my legs.</p>
